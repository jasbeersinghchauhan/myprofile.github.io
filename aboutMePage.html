            <p>Hello! I’m Jasbeer Singh Chauhan, a Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) student at Graphic Era Hill University (GEHU), Dehradun, Uttarakhand.
I’m passionate about software development and constantly driven to learn and grow in the tech field. My programming foundation includes C, C++, and Java, along with front-end skills in HTML and CSS. I’m also actively learning MySQL and backend integration techniques to build more complete and robust systems.
One of my key academic projects is the Advanced Library Management System (ALMS)—a full-featured application developed using C++, MySQL, and WinUI 3. This project demonstrates my ability to design modular systems and implement real-world functionality like book management, account handling, borrowed book tracking, and custom algorithms for sorting and searching. It also reflects my commitment to clean code, structured database interaction, and preparing my logic for UI integration with modern frameworks.
My academic background includes solid exposure to algorithms and data structures, particularly through my studies in Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA), where I’ve explored topics such as dynamic programming and graph theory.
Beyond academics, coding is more than a subject—it's my hobby and creative outlet. I’m always looking to explore new technologies, tools, and frameworks, and I genuinely enjoy solving problems and turning ideas into practical applications.</p>
