# 🖥️ Systems-Oriented Portfolio: JA_CHAUHAN

A terminal-inspired portfolio designed to showcase high-concurrency backend systems, low-level architecture, and scalable microservices.

## 🚀 Core Philosophy

This portfolio is engineered to reflect a backend-first mindset. While the frontend provides a "Command Center" interface, the heart of this repository is the documentation of systems-level logic, performance optimization, and distributed architecture.

## 🛠️ Technical Arsenal

- **Languages:** C++20 (Modern STL), JavaScript (Node.js/Express - _In Progress_)
- **Systems/Concurrency:** Multi-threading, Socket Programming (Winsock2), Semaphores
- **Data & Infrastructure:** Redis (Pub/Sub for Scaling), MongoDB, MySQL, ACID Compliance

## 📂 Highlighted Repositories

### 1. Multithreaded Proxy Server (C++20)

- **The Problem:** Handling high-volume HTTP traffic with minimal latency.
- **The Solution:** Implemented a custom Thread Pool and an **LRU Cache** to reduce latency by 40%.
- **Key Tech:** C++20, Winsock2, Thread Synchronization.

### 2. Secure Real-Time Messaging API (Node.js)

- **The Problem:** Solving the **C10k problem** for real-time communication.
- **The Solution:** Distributed state management using **Redis Pub/Sub** for horizontal scaling.
- **Key Tech:** Socket.io, JWT Middleware, Redis.

## 🌓 Interactive Features

- **System Terminal:** Simulates kernel module initialization and network topology mapping.
- **Command Palette:** `Ctrl + K` navigation for rapid system traversal.
- **Logic Inspector:** Real-time code snippets of core backend algorithms.

## 📈 Roadmap

- [ ] Implement a custom Express.js backend for the "Handshake" (Contact) module.
- [ ] Migrate static project data to a RESTful API.
- [ ] Integrate real-time system health monitoring via WebSockets.
